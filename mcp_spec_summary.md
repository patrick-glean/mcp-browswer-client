- Health check responses
- Status reporting

#### Logging
- Configurable log levels (debug to emergency)
- Structured log messages
- Server to client logging

### 4. Resource Management
- Resource listing and reading
- Resource templates
- Resource subscription for updates
- Support for text and binary resources

### 5. Tool Integration
